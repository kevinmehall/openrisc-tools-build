OpenRISC Toolchain Super-Project!
---------------------------------

To build the toolchain, do the following:

git submodule update --iniit
make -j3 PREFIX=<absolute install path>

To clear out all the build stamps and start a fresh build, run:

make clean

You can also force rebuilding from a certain component by just cleaning
out that component first.  For example:

make clean-uClibc; make -j3 PREFIX=<absolute install path>
